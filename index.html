          <p>
            Hi! Welcome to my portfolio I'm Mohammed Abdul Sattar.
            Let me tell you about myself.I am Computer Science and Engineering student in ICFAI TECH SCHOOL in Hyderabad.

          </p>
          <p>
            Presently,I am Working as a intern at <a href="https://uiprocorp.com/" target=_Blank>UIPRO CORPORATION PVT.LTD.</a>  
            As a beginner in the field of Information Technology, I strive to associate myself with an organization where I can utilize my skills in the best possible manner, which further gives me an opportunity to grow in my career journey while contributing to the development of the organization.
          </p>
          <!-- <p>
            My single greatest skill is
            problem solving. I have an insatiable desire to learn new skills. My
            passion lies in solving problems with technology. I have a knack for
            finding inefficiencies in a current system or way of doing things,
            and have an extremely high intuition for user experience . I am an
            idea machine and believe in bringing ideas and possibilities to the
            customer, instead of waiting for them to bring it to me.
          </p>
          <p>
            My Journey
            as a software developer started at the age of 19 when i was
            attending my bachelor degree in Electronic and communication.This
            has helped me to widen my range of knowledge and gather experiences
            through various diciplines, such as front-end developer,back-end
            developer and many more.
          </p> -->
